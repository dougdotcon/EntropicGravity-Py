While extant research on empathy has made signi ﬁcant progress in uncovering the mechanisms underlying
the responses of an observer (empathizer) to the distress of another (target), it remains unclear how the
interaction between the empathizer and the target contributes to distress regulation in the target. Here, we
propose that behavioral and neural coupling during empathic interactions contribute to diminished distress.
From November 2020 to November 2022, we recruited 37 pairs of previously unacquainted participants
(N=74) from multicultural backgrounds. They engaged in a 5 min face-to-face emotional sharing task,
where one participant shared a distressing biographical experience with the other participant. We used
functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure interbrain coupling in the emotion regulation
system, speci ﬁcally the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and the observation execution system,
speciﬁcally the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Results indicate that during emotional sharing the target and the
empathizer emotionally converge, such that the empathizer becomes sadder. Moreover, the levels of
empathizers ’empathy predicted both emotional convergence and target distress relief. The neuroimaging
ﬁndings indicate that interbrain coupling in the dlPFC, IFG, and premotor cortex, predicted distress relief
in the target, and more critically that interbrain coupling in the dlPFC played a mediating role in the
relationship between distress relief and the levels of empathy of the empathizer. Considering the role of the
dlPFC in emotion regulation, we conclude that interbrain coupling in this region during emotional sharing
plays a key role in dyadic coregulation of distress.

Humans have an inherent inclination to respond to the distress of
others ( Zaki & Williams, 2013 ). This is evident during the act of
comforting a crying infant or providing support to an emotionally
troubled friend. During these moments a signi ﬁcant dyadic
interaction unfolds, allowing one individual to relieve the distress
of another ( Niven, 2017 ;Reeck et al., 2016 ;Zaki & Williams, 2013 ).
One of the critical human capacities that may contribute to the ability
to regulate the other ’s emotions is empathy ( Lamm & Silani, 2014 ;
Zaki & Williams, 2013 ). Empathy is a multifaceted construct ( Davis,
1983) representing the ability to share the emotional state of others and
take their perspective ( Shamay-Tsoory, 2011 ) and may consequentlylead to the response of alleviating another ’s negative emotions. While
extensive research has focused on understanding the empathic
response of an observer (the empathizer) to the distress of another (the
target), there has been comparatively less emphasis on understanding
the alleviation of distress of the target in response to an empathic
response ( Main et al., 2017 ). Moreover, numerous studies tend to
neglect the interpersonal aspect of empathy by isolating it from other
concurrent emotional and cognitive processes, such as emotion
regulation processes ( Main et al., 2017 ;Zaki et al., 2008 ). Considering
empathy ’s fundamental and evolutionary purpose of relieving the
distress experienced by a suffering target ( Decety et al., 2016 ;

Reeck et al., 2016 ;Telle & P ﬁster, 2016 ;Zaki, 2020 ;Zaki &
Williams, 2013 ), there needs to be a shift in research allowing for a
more integrative framework of understanding empathy and distress
relief together as two tightly interrelated processes ( Franklin-Gillette
& Shamay-Tsoory, 2021 ).
To bridge this gap, we sought to investigate whether empathizers
can“tune in ”and align emotionally and neurally with another during
emotional sharing and whether this alignment contributes to distress
regulation in the target. To this end we examined the role of
interbrain coupling, the coherence of two time series of interacting
brains ( Nummenmaa et al., 2012 ), in distress relief during a
laboratory modeled empathic interaction. While the relationship
between distress relief and empathy through interbrain coupling has
not been directly examined before, certain elements within this
broader concept, such as face-to-face dialogue ( Jiang et al., 2012 ),
pain relief ( Goldstein et al., 2018 ), and shared pain ( Peng et al.,
2021 ), have been explored in dyadic neuroimaging studies,
suggesting that interbrain coupling in several networks supports
various types of connectedness in social interactions. Building on
these studies, we propose a model according to which the distress
relief of a target is linked to the empathizer ’s response and facilitated
through interbrain coupling in two possible neural systems:
(a) observation execution and (b) emotion regulation.
The observation execution system includes the inferior frontal
gyrus (IFG), the inferior parietal lobule ( Iacoboni et al., 2001 ;
Lestou et al., 2008 ), as well as the premotor cortex ( Wade &
Hammond, 2015 ). These brain regions have been demonstrated to
function in a manner where the observation of an action in someone
else has the capability to automatically trigger one ’s own mental
representations of that action ( Thornton & Knoblich, 2006 ).
Importantly, the observation execution system has been implicated
in understanding emotions ( Jabbi & Keysers, 2008 )b e l i e f s( Rizzolatti
& Sinigaglia, 2016 ) and vicarious pain ( Lamm et al., 2011 ). These
characteristics of the observation execution system suggest a
signiﬁcant role in enabling the empathizer to align their emotional
state with the target. This emotional alignment between interacting
individuals is commonly known as emotional contagion ( Dvash &
Shamay-Tsoory, 2014 ), a fundamental aspect of empathy ( Shamay-
Tsoory, 2011 ).
Notably, studies using functional near-infrared spectroscopy
(fNIRS), demonstrated that interbrain coupling within the IFG,
is associated with behaviors that require alignment, such as
communication during face-to-face dialogue between partners
(Jiang et al., 2012 ), movement synchronization ( Gamliel et al.,
2021 ;Marton-Alper et al., 2023 ), and synchrony during song
learning ( Pan et al., 2018 ). Considering the pivotal role of
interbrain coupling within the IFG during alignment, we expect
that emotional alignment will be associated with IFG coupling
during empathic interactions.
In addition to the emotional alignment, during emotional sharing,
individuals engage in the regulation of each other ’s emotions. This
phenomenon is commonly referred to as the social regulation of
emotion, involving the deliberate effort of one person (the empathizer)
to inﬂuence the emotional response of another individual (the target)
(Reeck et al., 2016 ). It was recently suggested that emotion regulation
and empathy are related processes involving highly similar executive
and internally oriented processes ( Morawetz et al., 2022 ). From
a theoretical perspective, both empathy and emotion regulation
share the common aim of regulating one ’s emotional states. Thisregulation can involve either amplifying or diminishing emotional
states by reevaluating the interpretation of one ’s own emotions or
those of others ( Thompson et al., 2019 ). Within the context of
emotional sharing, both the target and empathizer may coregulate
their emotions through interbrain coupling of their emotion
regulation networks. Neuroimaging studies of emotion regulation,
particularly those centered on cognitive strategies, have demon-
strated that effective regulation is facilitated by prefrontal networks
that exert modulation over predominantly subcortical emotion-
generating systems ( Buhle et al., 2014 ). Speci ﬁcally, dorsal
subdivisions of the prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; Barbey et al., 2013 ;
Wager & Smith, 2003 ) are known to play a crucial role in various
aspects of emotion regulation ( Dörfel et al., 2014 ;Kohn et al., 2014 ;
Morawetz et al., 2017 ;Ochsner et al., 2002 ,Zhao et al., 2021 ). For
example, previous neuroimaging research has shown that the dlPFC
is actively engaged in the direct attenuation of distressing emotions
and social pain ( Nishiyama et al., 2015 ,Zhao et al., 2021 ) and is also
implicated in the successful implementation of emotion regulation
strategies, particularly through cognitive reappraisal during explicit
emotion regulation ( Goldin et al., 2008 ). Therefore, successful
interbrain coupling of the IFG and dlPFC are expected to contribute
to distress regulation during empathic interaction.
The Present Research
While previous research on empathy has made substantial
progress in uncovering the underlying mechanisms that govern
empathic responses to a distressed target, the speci ﬁc impact of
empathizer –target interactions on distress regulation in the target
remains unknown. To examine the coupling of behavioral and
neural processes between distressed targets and empathizers, we
designed a laboratory modeled empathic interaction where a target
shares a sad personal story with a counterpart —the empathizer. In
this study, we hypothesize that on the behavioral level, (a) the target
and the empathizer will display emotional convergence, resulting in
their levels of distress becoming similar during the interaction and
that (b) the empathizer ’s levels of empathy toward the target during
the task will predict both the extent of emotional convergence and
target distress relief. An exploratory analysis will be conducted to
identify the speci ﬁc type of empathy involved, including personal
distress, emotional concern, and perspective taking. On the neural
level (c), we hypothesize that interbrain coupling in the dlPFC and
IFG will predict target distress relief and (d) that the dlPFC will
mediate the interaction between the empathizer ’s empathy and the
distress of the target.
Method
Participants
The sample size was determined through an a priori power
analysis performed using G *Power software, Version 3.1 ( Faul
et al., 2009 ), and data were not analyzed until data collection was
completed. The power analysis was performed for the main
hypothesis on the relationship between empathy and distress relief
(Hypothesis 2), which was tested with multiple regression
analysis. The power analysis used the following parameters: an
effect size f2of 0.25 (indicating a medium effect size, as reported in
studies with social interactions, Ferguson, 2016 ), anαlevel of .05,INTERBRAIN COUPLING DURING DISTRESS REGULATION 737

and a desired power of .80. With one predictor in the regression
model, the analysis indicated that a total sample size of 34 ( N=34
dyads, 68 participants) was required to achieve the desired power
level. Thus, the obtained sample size of N=37 was more than
adequate to test the study hypothesis.
To account for missing and damaged data we collected data from
45 dyads, from November 2020 to November 2022. Exclusion
criteria included psychopathology, medication use, or health
concerns. Two dyads were excluded from the experiment due to
health concerns, and six more dyads were further excluded from the
analysis due to fNIRS data acquisition dif ﬁculties and poor signal
quality, leaving a ﬁnal sample of 37 dyads (28 pairs of females,
mean age: 24.0 8 ± 3.83, age range: 18 –38). Participants, which
included a multicultural sample (28 Hebrew-speaking dyads and
nine Arabic-speaking dyads), were assigned to unacquainted same-
sex, same-handedness, and same-native tongue pairs to reduce the
effects of interpersonal variation. All participants provided written
informed consent and were compensated for their participation. The
study was granted ethical approval by the University of Haifa
Ethics Committee (ethics approval number #4,567,476) and was
performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Data
from this study are available upon direct request by contacting the
corresponding authors.
Procedure
Prior to the Day of the Experiment
Participants were recruited using ads posted via the internet and
around the university campus. Before the experiment, participants
underwent screening for exclusion criteria and were asked in an
online research platform, Qualtrics ( 2005 ;https://www.qualtrics
.com ), to write about a biographical event from their recent past
that they still perceive as sad, distressing, and eliciting negative
emotions.
To con ﬁrm that the distressing event produced negative affect,
participants completed the Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule
(PANAS; Watson et al., 1988 ) before and after writing the
distressing event. Only participants who demonstrated an increase in
the PANAS negative affect subscale after describing the distressing
event were recruited to the study. Participants were also requested to
provide a description of a biographical neutral event outlining the
sequence of events in their typical daily routine. This neutral event
functioned as a control for the distressing event that was shared on
the day of the experiment.
Examples of Distressing Events
The distressing events participants shared covered a large range of
topics such as the dif ﬁcult relationship with parents, romantic
breakups, con ﬂicts with roommates, coping with the passing of a
loved one, failing in school, unresolved con ﬂicts with siblings and
friends, and coping with medical conditions. An example of a real-
life distressing event shared by a target:
After 4 months together, my girlfriend left. I was deeply in love. …Our
connection was intellectual and unimaginable. The same day we broke-
up, she began dating a friend from my company. …I plunged into
severe depression, struggling to recover and function.Dyad Formation and Role Assignment
To ensure unbiased interaction dynamics, participants were
randomly assigned to either the “target ”role, sharing personal
events on the day of the experiment, or the “empathizer ”role,
listening to the target ’s personal events on the day of the experiment.
The randomization process considered sex and native language
(either Arabic or Hebrew). Each dyad was permitted to perform the
sharing tasks in their native language to enable ﬂuent and natural
discussions. Current literature suggests that both sex ( Mu et al.,
2016 ) and linguistic background ( Feng et al., 2023 ) may in ﬂuence
the dynamics of interbrain coupling, hence their consideration in
dyad formation. Age was not considered a variable for matching due
to the lack of empirical evidence linking it to variations in interbrain
coupling.
On the Day of the Experiment
Upon arrival, participants were ﬁtted with the Brite-24 fNIRS
system (Artinis Medical Systems, Elst, Netherlands) for continuous
brain activity recording. Due to the COVID-19 regulations, a
transparent glass divider was placed between the targets and
empathizers, allowing them to interact freely without needing to
wear a face mask during the emotional and neutral sharing tasks
(Figure 1 ).
Participants sat across from one another at approximately 150 cm.
Considering that paired targets and empathizers were unfamiliar
with each other, they were instructed to engage in a 5-min
acquaintance conversation before the sharing tasks, aiming to foster
a more natural interaction and connection. Emotional state was
assessed (PANAS and sadness levels) prior to the sharing tasks.
Emotional Sharing Task: (1) Recalling the Distressing
Event. Following the 5-min acquaintance conversation, participants
assigned to the role of the target were presented on a computer screen
with the text of their personal distressing event which they previously
shared in the online section of the study. To ensure full engagement
with the event, targets were instructed to read the event silently and
then write down their re ﬂections. For procedure standardization
purposes, participants assigned to the role of the empathizer, engaged
with their personal neutral events they had previously shared in the
online section of the study during this time. Sadness levels and
negative affect of targets and empathizers were measured after
engaging with the events.
Emotional Sharing Task: (2) Sharing the Distressing
Event. After targets engaged with their distressing event, the
experimenter asked them to share a detailed description of their
distressing event with the empathizer, including both their thoughts
and emotions. The empathizer was encouraged to be attentive and
engaged during this sharing process. During the 5-min sharing, there
was continuous fNIRS recording. Following the emotional sharing
task, both targets and empathizers reported their sadness levels and
negative affect with the negative affect scale, PANAS. In addition,
empathizers were speci ﬁcally asked about their empathy levels (i.e.,
state personal distress, state emotional concern, and state perspec-
tive taking) during the emotional sharing task.
Neutral Sharing Task. A neutral sharing task was included in
the study to serve as a control to the emotional sharing task. The
neutral sharing task procedure mirrored that of the emotional sharing
task, with the only difference being that the target recalled, engaged,738 AVNOR, ATIAS, MARKUS, AND SHAMAY-TSOORY

and shared his/her neutral content event, detailing his/her typical
day’s routine. The order of the tasks was counterbalanced between
dyads. The tasks were separated by a 5-min distraction task to
minimize potential carryover effects ( Figure 2 ).
Measures
Distraction Task
An object characteristics task was introduced between the
emotional and neutral sharing tasks to prevent potential carryovereffects. During this task, targets and empathizers were given 5-min
to jot down physical characteristics of common objects ( Fink et al.,
2010 ;Lu et al., 2021 ).
Assessment of Emotional State
Targets and empathizers reported their sadness levels and overall
negative affect in their respective native tongues (Hebrew or Arabic)
both pre- and postsharing tasks. Our focus on measuring sadness
levels, using a continuous 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 ( not at
all)t o5( to a very high degree ) was intentional, aligning with our
Figure 2
Illustration of the Emotional and Neutral Sharing Tasks
Note. The experiment included emotional and neutral sharing tasks, in counterbalanced order. During the emotional sharing
task, targets recalled and shared their personal distressing events, while in the neutral task, they recalled and shared their daily
routine neutral event. Empathizers actively listened throughout both tasks. Self-report measures included the negative affect
subscale of PANAS and sadness levels. Speci ﬁcally postemotional sharing, empathizers reported their state empathy levels
(personal distress, emotional concern, perspective taking). Brain activity was continuously recorded with fNIRS. Participant role

primary goal of eliciting sadness during the emotional sharing task.
Furthermore, to af ﬁrm that the emotional sharing task effectively
induced a broader negative emotional state, we utilized the Negative
Affect Scale from the PANAS. The PANAS is a well-validated self-
report questionnaire comprising of 20 emotions divided into two
dispositional dimensions: Negative Affect (NA) and Positive Affect
(PA). The NA scale includes the following 10 items: distressed,
upset, guilty, ashamed, hostile, irritable, nervous, jittery, scared, and
afraid. Each emotion is graded on a 5-point Likert scale, expressing
the extent of which this feeling is being experienced, ranging from 1
(not at all )t o5( to a very high degree ). The PANAS exhibits robust
internal consistency reliability with Cronbach ’sαranging from .84
to .87 for Negative Affect, as it also shows strong construct and
convergent validity ( Crawford & Henry, 2004 ). In our study, the
items of the NA subscale also showed high internal consistency ( α=
.82; based on the ﬁrst PANAS measurement prior to any
engagement with sharing tasks).
Assessment of State Empathy
To explore the role of empathy during the emotional sharing task,
we asked empathizers to report their empathy levels after hearing the
target ’s sad story. Given that empathy is a multifaceted construct, it
was important to examine empathy during the emotional sharing
task in a similar manner as presented in the Interpersonal Reactivity
Index (IRI; Davis, 1983 ). While the IRI quali ﬁes trait empathy into
four different subscales (personal distress, emotional concern,
personal distress, and fantasy) it was essential for the purpose of
our experiment to qualify state empathy, recognizing potential
differences between trait and state ( Batson et al., 1987 ).
The adaptation procedure of empathy items from trait to state
included taking 25 items from all four subscales of the original IRIand adapting them speci ﬁcally to an online empathy task showing
colored pictures of hands and feet in painful scenarios (task images
adapted from Naor et al., 2020 ).
After the presentation of the painful pictures, 32 healthy
participants were asked to rate on a scale of 1 –5 their state empathy
levels during the task. The internal consistency of the items within
each subscale were examined with Cronbach ’sα. Results showed
high internal consistency between the items in each subscale: State
Fantasy subscale ( α=.81), State Emotional Concern subscale ( α=
.81), State Personal Distress subscale ( α=.84), and Moderately
High internal consistency between the items in the state perspective
taking scale ( α=.75). Due to the high internal consistency observed
in the state IRI items across all subscales, we opted to choose one
item from the subscales for the emotional sharing task. The fantasy
subscale was excluded from our task as it lacked direct applicability
to real-time conversational contexts. These are the state IRI items
presented to the empathizers after the emotional sharing task:
(a)“While listening to my partner, I felt apprehensive and ill-at-
ease”(adapted from the personal distress scale); (b) “While listening
to my partner share his/her story, I had tender and concerned feelings
for him/her ”(adapted from the empathic concern scale); (c) “While
listening to my partner, I felt that I understood my partner ’s thoughts
and feelings ”(adapted from the perspective taking scale).
Neural Measure
Neural Signal Acquisition. Brain activity was measured with
the Brite-24 fNIRS system using Artinis Medical Systems ’OxySoft
software, Version 3.4.12.5. The optode montage covered bilateral
prefrontal cortical areas with a total of 24 channels, including ﬁve
transmitters and four detectors on each hemisphere ( Figure 3 ). The
optode placement followed the international 10 –20 system anchor
Figure 3
Placement Against Anatomical Brain Areas
Note. All available channels, right-side view (A); all available channels, left-side view (B); channels (marked as
black lines) are formed between transmitters (light/red dots), and adjacent receivers (dark/blue dots). Channels
cover six anatomical regions of interest: left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), right IFG, left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (dlPFC), right dlPFC, left premotor area and right premotor area. See the online article for the color version

points, inion, nasion, top center (Cz), and left and right tragus, and
conﬁrmation of alignment with the 1,020 system was conducted
using a Polhemus Patriot 3D Digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester,
Vermont, United States). The fNIRS placement was adjusted for
different head sizes by ﬁtting each participant with a suitable cap
determined by their head diameter and adherence to the 10 –20
system criteria ( Khazi et al., 2012 ). Montreal Neurological Institute
coordinates for each optode and channel are provided (see
Tables A1 –A2). Transmitters emitted light at two wavelengths in
the near-infrared spectrum, 760 nm and 850 nm, while each adjacent
detector measured their re ﬂectance. To maximize the transmission
of light through the scalp, a lighted probe was used to remove hair
underneath each optode. Data were sampled at a rate of 50 samples
per second and the OxySoft software adjusted raw signals,
accounting for the participant ’s bone density, calculated based on
their age.
Signal Preprocessing. The light absorption levels for each of
the two wavelengths (760 nm and 850 nm) in every available
channel were transformed into concentration changes for oxyhe-
moglobin (O2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), and their sum, using
the modi ﬁed Beer –Lambert equation ( Cope et al., 1988 ). In the
present study, we focused on measured changes in brain activity
using the oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) signal, as it was found to be more
accurate and sensitive to changes in blood ﬂow in fNIRS research
(Hoshi, 2007 ). Signal preprocessing was conducted with Homer3
software ( Huppert et al., 2009 ) using Matlab R2023a ( The
MathWorks Inc, 2022 ). The preprocessing steps undertaken are
described as follows: (1) All fNIRS channels were manually
inspected with the Homer3 software for the presence of heartbeat
(∼1 Hz). Channels in which no heartbeat was detected were
excluded from further analyses. (2) Raw intensity values were
converted to optical density (OD) using the modi ﬁed Beer –Lambert
law. (3) Motion artifacts were removed using two methods: (a) using
standard deviation ( SD) and amplitude change thresholding over
0.5 s windows and (b) using a spline correction method to remove
motion-induced spikes in the signal. (4) A bandpass ﬁlter (hpf =
0.01 Hz.; lpf =0.5 Hz.) was applied to the signal to remove artifacts
related to cardiovascular and pulmonary activity. (5) The OD values
were converted to O2Hb and HHb concentration values for further
analysis.
Anatomical Regions of Interest. Anatomical regions of
interest (ROIs) were selected, comprising six areas: left IFG, right
IFG, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), right dlPFC, left
premotor area, and right premotor area. Concentration values of
preprocessed O2Hb from fNIRS channels covering each ROI were
averaged per participant, excluding channels with no detected
heartbeat, creating a singular data vector per ROI per participant.
Interbrain Coupling Analysis. We performed wavelet trans-
form coherence (WTC) analysis, using the WTC toolbox for Matlab
(Grinsted et al., 2004 ) to assess interbrain coupling (i.e., brain
synchrony). WTC values of O2Hb concentration vectors were
obtained, using a Morlet wavelet, the mother wavelet function. This
Morlet function was constructed for wavelengths in the range of
6–66 s (∼0.015 Hz –∼0.1666 Hz), following the expected time-
range of the blood oxygenation level dependent signals, as part of
the hemodynamic response function ( Müller et al., 2004 ). WTC was
calculated between data vectors representing each ROI of the target
and those representing each ROI of the empathizer. Overall, we
analyzed 36 ROI combinations for each dyad, including bothhomologous and nonhomologous regions. The resultant WTC
matrices were separated into epochs, representing the time course
of each experimental task. The resultant segments were averaged
across the selected wavelengths, which allowed us to produce a
single numeric value representing the mean coherence value in each
condition for each ROI combination.
Statistical Analysis
Behavioral Data Analyses
Data pertaining to self-reported emotional states (sadness levels
and negative affect) during the emotional and neutral sharing tasks
were analyzed with linear mixed effects (LME) models using the R
language Version 4.2.3 ( Baayen et al., 2008 ), and the lme4 package
(Bates et al., 2007 ) which allows testing for interaction effects
between two or more ﬁxed factors while accounting for the
dependency between related observations. Beyond this, we
performed exploratory regression analyses to assess which speci ﬁc
type of state empathy (emotional concern, perspective taking, and
personal distress) contributes to emotional convergence and target
distress relief during the emotional sharing task. All comparisons
were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons. For some of
these analyses, IBM SPSS Version 27.0 was used.
Furthermore, to quantify dyadic emotional convergence into a
single score, we calculated the change in dyadic sadness levels from
presharing ( t1) to postsharing ( t2):
Δ1=ðTarget ’s sadness levels at t1Þ
–ðEmpathizer ’s sadness levels att1Þ, (1)
Δ2=ðTarget ’s sadness levels at t2Þ
–ðEmpathizer ’s sadness levels at t2Þ, (2)
jΔ1j−jΔ2j=emotional convergence score : (3)
The emotional convergence score of each dyad indicated the
extent to which empathizers and their targets jointly shift toward
each other ’s emotional state throughout the sharing.
Neural Data Analyses
WTC data were also analyzed using LME models. For analysis
purposes, we generated a set of dyad pseudopairings to test whether
interbrain coupling in the real-dyads was signi ﬁcantly above chance
level. For this, we created a group of 37 pseudodyads by randomly
pairing participants who did not interact with each other in our
experiment. Pseudopairs consisted of a real target matched with a
random empathizer from another dyad. The calculated WTC values
for pseudodyads served as an initial examination con ﬁrming that
observed effects of interbrain coupling were not an artifact of the
fact that individuals were performing a similar task. Multiple linear
regression analysis was further utilized to assess which of the ROI
interbrain coupling combinations predict target distress relief.
Finally, we carried out a mediation analysis to examine whether
interbrain coupling mediates the relationship between empathy and
distress relief.INTERBRAIN COUPLING DURING DISTRESS REGULATION 741

Manipulation Check: Self-Reported Negative Affect
We used LMEs modeling to analyze negative affect levels among
study participants. The LME model considered self-reported negative
affect (Negative Affect subscale, PANAS) as the dependent variable,
incorporating ﬁxed factors such as role (target, empathizer), time of
measurement (presharing: event recall, postsharing), and condition
(neutral sharing task, emotional sharing task). In addition, the dyads ’
assigned couple number was treated as a random factor.
We constructed three versions of the LME model, each one
incrementally increasing in complexity. This hierarchical approach
allowed us to assess the impact of each level of complexity on the
explanatory power of the model. The ﬁrst LME model examined
only the main effects of ﬁxed factors (one-way); the second LME
model incorporated interactions of up to two levels (two-way); andthe third LME model considered potential interactions among all
ﬁxed factors (three-way).
LME model comparison, evaluated through Type II Wald χ2tests,
revealed that the second LME model (two-way) demonstrated
signiﬁcantly enhanced predictive power compared to the ﬁrst LME
model, χ2(3)=18.83; p<.001; χ2(3)=12.63; p<.01, whereas the
third LME model did not provide signi ﬁcantly better predictions, as
compared to the second, χ2(1)=0.79; n.s.The second model was
therefore used in further analyses.
The selected LME model revealed a signi ﬁcant main effect for
role, F(1, 253) =25.97, p<.0001, η2p=0.09, due to overall higher
NA levels among targets ( M=16.26, SD=7.3) compared to
empathizers ( M=13.28, SD=4.28). There was also a main effect
for condition, F(1, 253) =29.63, p<.0001, η2p=0.1, with overall
higher NA levels in the emotional sharing task ( M=16.36, SD=
6.97) compared the neutral sharing task ( M=13.18, SD=4.74).
Since the LME model also showed a signi ﬁcant interaction between
condition and role, F(1, 253) =11.87, p<.001, η2p=0.04, pairwise
comparisons with Bonferroni correction were carried out. The
analysis revealed signi ﬁcantly increased NA levels among targets in
the emotional sharing task ( M=18.85, SD=8.08) in comparison to
the neutral sharing task ( M=13.66, SD=5.32), χ2(1)=39.5; p<
.0001, further con ﬁrming the manipulation of our emotional sharing
task in inducing negative affect. There were no signi ﬁcant differences
between conditions among empathizers, χ2(1)=2;n.s.;Figure 4 ).
Manipulation Check: Self-Reported Sadness Levels
We further utilized the same LME modeling method described
above for negative affect assessment to assess sadness levels.
Sadness levels were used as the dependent variable, with ﬁxed and
random factors consistent with those in the LME model for negative

affect. Following a similar hierarchical approach, we developed
three versions of this LME model, each increasing in complexity.
To select the LME model that demonstrated enhanced predictive
power, we compared the three models with Type II Wald χ2tests,
revealing that the second model (two-way) demonstrated signi ﬁcantly
enhanced predictive power compared to the ﬁrst model, χ2(3)=
18.83; p<.001. As the third model did not yield signi ﬁcantly
improved predictions over the second model, χ2(1)=1.89; n.s., the
second model was selected for subsequent analysis.
The LME model revealed a signi ﬁcant main effect for role, F(1,
252) =18.32, p<.0001, η2p=0.07, with overall higher sadness
levels among targets ( M=1.98, SD=1.18) compared to
empathizers ( M=1.51, SD=0.92). The analysis also revealed a
main effect for condition, F(1, 252) =46.41, p<.0001, η2p=0.16,
with overall higher sadness levels in the emotional sharing
condition ( M=2.11, SD=1.19) compared to the neutral sharing
condition ( M=1.37, SD=0.8). Furthermore, there was a
signiﬁcant interaction between role and time, F(1, 252) =6.32,
p<.05,η2p=0.02, and between condition and role, F(1, 252) =
9.53, p<.01,η2p=0.04.
To further understand the signi ﬁcant interaction between
condition and role, pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction
revealed increased sadness levels among targets in the emotional
sharing condition ( M=2.52, SD=1.22) in comparison to the
neutral sharing condition ( M=1.44, SD=0.86), χ2(1)=49.17, p<
.0001. This outcome demonstrates the validation of the task
manipulation, as engaging with distressing biographical events led
to an increase in sadness levels among the targets. Interestingly,
empathizers also showed increased sadness levels in the emotional
sharing condition ( M=1.72, SD=1.04) in comparison to the
neutral sharing condition ( M=1.31, SD=0.74), χ2(1)=6.91,
p<.05.
Considering that dyads consisted exclusively of either males or
females and performed sharing tasks in a counterbalanced order,
dyad sex and order of condition completion were incorporated as
additional ﬁxed factors in the LME models. This was done to assess
their potential impact on sadness levels and negative affect. Main
effects were found nonsigni ﬁcant in the LME model predicting
sadness levels, sex: F (1, 34) =0.23; n.s.,order: F (1, 34) =0.22;
n.s., and NA levels, sex: F (1, 34) =1.37; n.s.,order: F (1, 34) =
1.23; n.s. Therefore, dyad sex and order of condition completion
were not included in the ﬁnal LME models depicted above.
Emotional Convergence
To explore our ﬁrst hypothesis, whether the sadness levels of
interacting targets and empathizers converged during the emotional
sharing task, we utilized the third LME model described above,
which considers all potential interactions among ﬁxed factors (three-
way). Sadness levels served as the dependent variable and all the
ﬁxed and random factors were the same. The model revealed a
signiﬁcant main effect for role, F(1, 252) =18.42, p<.0001, η2p=
0.07, and condition, F(1, 252) =46.62, p<.0001, η2p=0.16, a
signiﬁcant interaction between role and time, F(1, 252) =6.31, p<
.05,η2p=0.02, and between condition and role, F(1, 252) =9.53,
p<.01,η2p=0.04.
To assess the similarity of sadness levels both before ( Δ1)
and after ( Δ2) the emotional/neutral sharing between targets and
their empathizers, we conducted further analyses using pairwisecomparisons with Bonferroni correction. In the emotional sharing
task,ﬁndings showed that Δ1 gaps between empathizers ( M=1.44,
SD=0.85) and their targets ( M=2.66, SD=1.19) were found
signiﬁcantly different, χ2(1)=31.75; p<.001, whereas Δ2 gaps
between empathizers ( M=1.99, SD=1.14) and their targets ( M=
2.37, SD=1.25) were not found signi ﬁcantly different, χ2(1)=
3.09; n.s., suggesting that targets and empathizers experienced
emotional convergence during the emotional sharing task ( Figure 5 ).
Further analysis of the dynamics underlying the convergence of
sadness levels showed that for empathizers, there was a signi ﬁcant
increase in their sadness levels from presharing to postsharing, χ2(1)=
6.46; p<.05, ( Figure 5 ), while no signi ﬁcant differences were found
among targets, χ2(1)=1.78, n.s.
In the neutral sharing task, Δ1 gaps between empathizers ( M=
1.38, SD=0.84) and their targets ( M=1.63, SD=1.1) were not
found signi ﬁcantly different, χ2(1)=1.4;n.s., as well as Δ2 gaps
between empathizers ( M=1.24, SD=0.61) and their targets ( M=
1.25, SD=0.54), χ2(1)=0.0006; n.s. Further analysis revealed that
empathizers showed no signi ﬁcant changes in their sadness levels
between presharing and postsharing, χ2(1)=0.39, n.s., and neither
did targets, χ2(1)=3.18; n.s.These ﬁndings suggest that targets and
empathizers did not experience emotional convergence during the
neutral sharing task.
Empathy and Distress Regulation During Emotional
Sharing Task
To examine the relationship between empathy and distress relief,
we conducted an exploratory stepwise regression analysis, including
the three items of state empathy. These items served as possible
predictors of the sadness levels among targets postsharing. Only the

Note. The means and standard errors of sadness levels for targets and
empathizers in each of the sharing tasks are displayed. Sadness levels were
signiﬁcantly higher in the emotional sharing task compared to the neutral
sharing task among targets and empathizers. In the emotional sharing task,
initial Δ1 gaps were found signi ﬁcantly different between targets and
empathizers, while Δ2g a p sw e r en o tf o u n ds i g n i ﬁcantly different, supporting
the emergence of emotional convergence. In the emotional sharing task,
empathizers showed a signi ﬁcant increase in sadness levels from presharing to
postsharing. See the online article for the color version of this ﬁgure.INTERBRAIN COUPLING DURING DISTRESS REGULATION 743

regression model including the perspective taking item ( β=−0.42;
t=−2.71) as a predictor was found statistically signi ﬁcant,
accounting for 17.3% of the variance in the sadness levels, F(1, 35) =
7.33, p=.01, Adj R2=0.15, ( Figure 6 ). This result indicates that
greater levels of empathy displayed by the empathizers corresponded
to lower postsharing levels of sadness among the targets.
Furthermore, to examine the relationship between empathy and
emotional convergence during the emotional sharing task, an
exploratory stepwise regression analysis was carried out. Dyads ’
emotional convergence score was the dependent variable and the
three state empathy items ’(personal distress, perspective taking,
emotional concern) scores served as possible predictors. A
statistically signi ﬁcant regression model that accounted for
13.12% of the variance in dyads ’emotional convergence, F(1,
35)=5.28, p=.028, Adj R2=0.11, revealed that the personal
distress item ( β=0.36; t=2.3) signi ﬁcantly predicted the levels of
emotional convergence (see Figure 7 ).
Interbrain Coupling Results
Real-Dyads and Pseudodyads
To examine whether participants exhibit differences in interbrain
coupling when assigned to a real-dyad as compared to a
pseudodyad, we employed an LME model, which included group
assignment (pseudo/real), condition (emotional sharing/neutral
sharing), and ROI combinations as ﬁxed factors, dyad ’s couple
number served as a random factor, and coherence (WTC) values as a
dependent measure. We constructed three versions of this model, in
increasing order of complexity: The ﬁrst analyzed only the main
effects of the ﬁxed factors (one-way); the second added interactions
of up to two levels (two-way); the third also included a possible
interaction between all the ﬁxed factors (three-way). The models
were compared using Type II Wald χ2comparison tests and showed
that the second model yielded a signi ﬁcantly greater predictive
power than the ﬁrst model, χ2(71)=112.88; p<.01, whereas thethird model did not provide a signi ﬁcantly better predictions, as
compared to the second, χ2(35) =46.36; n.s.Analysis of the
second model revealed a signi ﬁcant main effect of the group
assignment, F(1, 76) =11.45, p<.01,η2p=0.13, due to overall
higher interbrain coupling values among Real-dyads ( M=0.33,
SD=0.04) compared to pseudodyads ( M=0.31, SD=0.04). The
analysis also yielded a signi ﬁcant interaction between group
assignment and ROI, F(35, 14068) =2.25, p<.0001, η2p=0.005.
Further analyses revealed 12 ROI combinations of target-
empathizer coupling which signi ﬁcantly differed between real-
dyads and pseudodyads across the conditions (for detailed
comparisons see Table A3 ). All comparisons were corrected with
the false discovery rate corre ction for multiple comparisons.
Note that in each coupling combination, the ﬁrst ROI represents
the target, and the second ROI represents the empathizer (see
Figure 8 ).
Interbrain Coupling and Distress Relief
As indicated above, 12 interbrain coupling combinations showed
a signi ﬁcant difference in the coherence values between real-dyads
and pseudodyads. Only real ROI combinations that were found to be
signiﬁcantly different from pseudo were used in further analyses. To
assess which of these 12 ROI interbrain coupling combinations may
predict changes in the sadness levels of the targets, we conducted a
multiple regression analysis. The regression analysis included
sadness levels among targets (postsharing) as the predicted variable,
and the WTC values of the 12 ROI interbrain coupling combinations,
taken during the emotional sharing task, as the possible predictors.
The regression model was found to be signi ﬁcant, F(12, 22) =2.94,
p=.01, Adj R2=0.407, and accounted for 61.62% percent of
the variance in the sadness levels. The coherence levels in six of
the interbrain coupling combinations were found to be signi ﬁcant
predictors of the sadness levels among targets. The signi ﬁcant
predictors are as follows: L. dlPFC-R. dlPFC coupling ( β=−0.668;
Figure 6
Empathy as Predictor of Sadness Levels
Note. Higher levels of state empathy, speci ﬁcally perspective taking, exhibited by empathizers
during the emotional sharing task were associated with reduced sadness levels among targets after
sharing. While participants could rate their state empathy for perspective taking ( x-axis) on a scale
from 1 to 5, participants ’ratings fell exclusively between 3 and 5 ( M=4.59, SD=0.551). See the

t=3.21; p=.004), R. dlPFC-R. IFG coupling ( β=0.701; t=
2.95; p=.007), R. dlPFC-R. premotor coupling ( β=−0.868; t=
−3.7;p=.001), R. IFG- R. IFG coupling ( β=−0.47; t=−2.27;
p=.033), R. IFG- R. premotor coupling ( β=−0.449; t=−2.14;
p=.044).
Mediation Analysis
Based on the supportive evidence indicating a negative correlation
between perspective taking (empathizers) and sadness levels (targets),and the association between dlPFC coupling (particularly, L. dlPFC-
R. dlPFC) and targets ’sadness levels, we proceeded to investigate
the dlPFC as a potential mediator between empathy and sadness
levels. We integrated these results into a mediation analysis with a
bootstrapping method where dlPFC coupling served as the mediator
between the independent variable of state empathy score among
empathizers and sadness levels among targets after sharing.
The results indicated that the effect of empathy among empathizers
on the sadness levels of the targets was partially mediated by the
coherence levels in the L. dlPFC-R. dlPFC during the sharing task.
AsFigure 9 illustrates, the total effect of empathizers ’empathy onFigure 7

the targets ’sadness levels ( b=−0.41, p<.01; 95% CI [ −0.83,
−0.12]) was still signi ﬁcant when L. dlPFC-R. dlPFC coupling was
added to the equation ( b=−0.3,p<.05; 95% CI [ −0.72,−0.02]).
The indirect effect of empathizers ’empathy on the targets ’sadness
levels was signi ﬁcant ( b=−0.11, p<.05; 95% CI [0.31, −0.01]), as
well as the mediation proportion ( b=0.27, p<.05). Therefore, L.
dlPFC-R. dlPFC coupling during emotional sharing was found to
partially mediate the relationship between the empathy among
empathizers during emotional sharing and the sadness levels among
their targets.
As there were other signi ﬁcant ROI predictors of the targets ’
sadness levels, we explored these additional ROI interbrain couplings
as potential mediators in the empathy –distress relief relationship.
Consequently, ﬁve mediation models were run, each incorporating a
different potential mediator: L. dlPFC-R. premotor, R. dlPFC-R. IFG,
R. dlPFC-R. premotor, R. IFG- R. IFG, and R. IFG- R. However,
none of these mediation models produced signi ﬁcant results.
Furthermore, to rule out the alternative model, according to which
empathy mediates the relationship between interbrain coupling and
sadness levels, we carried out an additional mediation analysis
which showed that the total effect of L. dlPFC-R. dlPFC coupling on
the targets ’sadness levels ( b=−0.45, p<.01; 95% CI [ −0.9,
−0.17]) was still signi ﬁcant when empathy was added to the
equation ( b=−0.36, p<.01; 95% CI [ −0.8,−0.09]). The indirect
effect of L. dlPFC-R. dlPFC coupling on the targets ’sadness levels
via empathy was not signi ﬁcant ( b=−0.09, n.s.; 95% CI [ −0.3, 0]),
indicating that empathy does not mediate the relationship between
interbrain coupling and the target ’s sadness levels. All the mediation
analyses were conducted using the bootstrapping method (5,000
bootstrapped samples were calculated in each analysis).
Discussion
Considering that empathy has developed evolutionarily to
alleviate the distress experienced by others ( Decety et al., 2016 ;Reeck et al., 2016 ;Telle & P ﬁster, 2016 ;Zaki, 2020 ;Zaki &
Williams, 2013 ), it is imperative to develop a comprehensive
framework that uni ﬁes empathy and emotional relief as inter-
connected processes. Addressing this research gap, the present
study employed a novel face-to-face laboratory modeled empathic
interaction involving a distressed target and an empathizer. This
approach enabled the examination of interbrain coupling as a critical
mechanism, allowing relief for the target sharing their personal
distressing story and fostering empathy in the interacting partner.
The Emotional Sharing Task: Distress Induction
Validation
To validate the ef ﬁcacy of our emotional sharing task in inducing
distress, we compared both self-reported sadness levels and overall
negative affect (Negative Affect subscale, PANAS) to those
reported in a neutral sharing task. The results con ﬁrmed that our
emotional sharing task, which included the recalling and re ﬂecting
of a distressing biographical event, elevated sadness levels and
negative affect among targets. Furthermore, empathizers also
showed increased sadness levels in the emotional sharing task in
comparison to the neutral sharing task, demonstrating that listening
to someone else ’s distressing biographical event elevates sadness
levels.
Convergence of Distress Levels Between Target and
Empathizer
Throughout the emotional sharing task, as targets shared their sad
narratives and as empathizers actively engaged and listened, a
convergence of their emotional states was observed. Originally
characterized by a large emotional gap between the target and
empathizer (re ﬂected in their signi ﬁcantly different sadness levels
prior to the interaction), this gap diminished by the end of the
interaction (re ﬂected in their nonsigni ﬁcant sadness levels). ThisFigure 9

coefﬁcients between empathy and sadness levels, controlling for the interbrain coupling. dlPFC =

observed manifestation of emotional convergence may be construed
as indicative of emotional synchronization taking place during
emotional sharing, developing gradually through bidirectional
exchange of verbal and nonverbal behaviors. Such examples may
be the continuous matching of target and empathizers ’motor
behaviors such as facial expression ( Dimberg et al., 2000 ;Olszanowski
et al., 2019; Riehle et al., 2017 ) body posture ( Chartrand & Bargh,
1999;Varlet et al., 2011 ) and vocal characteristics ( Imel et al., 2014 ).
According to the primitive contagious model ( Hatﬁeld et al., 1994 ),
humans hold the ability to feel each other ’s emotional state through
synchronized facial expressions, body postures, and voices as they
adopt one another ’s muscular con ﬁguration, which provides a
congruent emotional experience.
The in ﬂuence of the interactants ’nonverbal synchrony on
emotional state has been previously shown ( Tschacher et al., 2014 )
and may serve as a primary mechanism for emotional convergence.
Empathizer ’s Empathy Predicts Convergence of
Distress Levels
To further understand the spontaneous emotional convergence
that emerged between a target and empathizer, we explored the
potential in ﬂuence of the empathizer ’s empathy levels on the
process. We found that increased levels of emotional convergence at
the end of the emotional sharing task was signi ﬁcantly predicted
by higher levels of empathizer ’s self-reported empathy, further
indicating that the tendency of target and empathizer to emotionally
converge represents a core empathic response. Among the measured
forms of state empathy, it was speci ﬁcally personal distress that
signiﬁcantly predicted the emotional convergence of sadness levels.
Characterized as an empathic response, personal distress is described
as a self-oriented sensation of discomfort in response to another
individual ’s condition ( Davis, 1980 ). It has been suggested that
personal distress arises from the lack of boundaries between oneself
and others ( Decety & Lamm, 2006 ). In the context of the emotional
sharing task, this lack of boundaries becomes evident between the
target and empathizer. As participants engage in the task, the
empathizer ’s experience of personal distress becomes a bridge for
the convergence of emotional states, fostering a shared emotional
experience.
Empathizer ’s Levels of Empathy Predict Target ’s
Distress Relief
To further understand whether a meaningful relationship between
state empathy and distress relief exists, we explored if the
empathizer ’s empathy levels would signi ﬁcantly predict the target ’s
sadness levels following the emotional sharing. We found that the
target ’s sadness levels were signi ﬁcantly negatively predicted by the
empathizer ’s levels of empathy during the emotional sharing task.
Among the measured forms of state empathy, it was speci ﬁcally
perspective taking, a form of cognitive empathy, which signi ﬁcantly
predicted targets ’sadness levels. Cognitive empathy involves
components such as mentalizing ( Tamir & Thornton, 2018 ) and
refers to understanding someone ’s perspective ( Shamay-Tsoory,
2011 ). It is possible that it is primarily cognitive empathy (i.e.,
perspective taking), as opposed to emotional empathy (i.e.,
emotional concern and personal distress), that is most effective in
contexts where interpersonal emotion regulation is needed toalleviate distress. This distinction in the effectiveness of cognitive
versus emotional empathy in interpersonal emotion regulation
contexts has been previously documented in the literature. In line
with this, it was shown that in the context of romantic dyads, higher
levels of trait cognitive empathy and not trait affective empathy
predicted better emotion regulation by a romantic-partner ( Levy-
Gigi & Shamay-Tsoory, 2017 ). Also, in a study exploring the
process of adaptive empathy, where empathizers select emotion
regulation strategies based on real-time feedback to reduce the
distress of a target person, it was found that cognitive empathy
abilities, but not affective empathy abilities were positively
associated with learning about the effectiveness of emotion
regulation strategies ( Kozakevich Arbel et al., 2021 ).
Consistent with our ﬁndings that emotional and cognitive
empathy differentially impact emotion regulation, similar patterns
are observed in intrapersonal contexts. Research indicates that
higher levels of perspective taking correlate with decreased emotion
dysregulation ( Contardi et al., 2016 ;Okun et al., 2000 ). Conversely,
elevated levels of affective empathy are linked to increased
empathic stress ( Powell, 2018 ). The tendency of emotional empathy
to involve direct and shared emotional experiences ( Bernhardt &
Singer, 2012 ;Decety & Jackson, 2004 ) may lead to more intense
and frequent emotional responses ( Eisenberg & Okun, 1996 ;
Eisenberg, 2000 ). Such heightened emotional reactivity can
compromise cognitive control ( Mueller, 2011 ) essential for managing
emotions effectively. Thus, while cognitive empathy may mitigate
emotional dysregulation, higher levels of emotional empathy could
exacerbate empathic stress, impacting both personal and relational
emotional management. Furthermore, given that many forms of
adaptive emotion regulation strategies are reliant upon similar
processes and neural architecture to those that support cognitive
empathy ( Morawetz et al., 2022 ) it could be the case that higher
cognitive empathy is associated with improved ef ﬁciency of the
cognitive control processes that also underlie the ability to regulate
other’s emotions.
Furthermore, empathy may alleviate distress in others by fostering
as e n s eo f “felt understanding, ”wherein a target acknowledges that
their interaction partner has genuinely grasped and responded to
fundamental aspects of th eir emotional experience ( Reis et al., 2004 ,
2017). While felt understanding is repor ted to diminish stress and boost
positive affect among partner s in close relationships ( Gable et al., 2004 ;
Lippert & Prager, 2001 ;Lun et al., 2008 ), among strangers, felt
understanding also decreases negative affect ( Seehausen et al.,
2012 ). This may be because feeling understood activates neural
regions previously associated with reward and social connection
(Morelli et al., 2014 ).
Ourﬁndings that distress relief was associated with empathy
levels during the emotional sharing task are in line with the previous
studies which have also demonstrated empathy ’s role in reducing
other forms of distress, such as physical pain ( Goldstein et al., 2016 ,
2018 ). For example, in a study examining pain relief through social
touch, Goldstein et al. (2016) found a signi ﬁcant negative relationship
between the toucher ’s empathy and the pain experience of their
female partner, suggesting that empathy between partners may
explain the pain-alleviating effects of social touch. Moreover,
according to the biosocial model ( Linehan, 1997 ), providing an
empathic response to a distressed other who is sharing his pain-
related feelings, promotes a feeling of validation and acceptanceINTERBRAIN COUPLING DURING DISTRESS REGULATION 747

which directly contributes to reduction in negative affect, and
consequently a reduction in pain ( Edmond & Keefe, 2015 ).
Interbrain Coupling of IFG, Premotor Cortex, and
DLPFC Predicts Target ’s Distress Relief
The neuroimaging results showed that increased interbrain
coupling in regions of the targets and empathizer ’so b s e r v a t i o n

emotional sharing task. Interbrain coupling in the IFG and premotor

et al., 2001 ;Lestou et al., 2008 ;Wade & Hammond, 2015 ), were
signiﬁcant predictors of target distress relief. As these areas enable
individuals to understand others ’actions and intentions through the
generation of congruent representations of the other in the self (IFG;
Jabbi & Keysers, 2008 ) and are activated both in observation and
imitation (premotor; Carr et al., 2003 ,Leslie et al., 2004 ), it is possible
that interbrain coupling within these regions represents blurring of the
boundaries between the self and other ( Hove, 2008 ). This blurring can
evoke a sense of oneness ( Swann et al., 2012 ) and as a result, the
target may begin to feel more like the empathizer, less sad. The target
may also experience distress relief through the activation of the
observation execution system as it has been shown that alignment (as
seen in mimicry) induces positive affect by activating reward related
processes in the brain ( Kühn et al., 2010 ).
While involvement of the observation execution system may
facilitate distress relief in the target, it may also promote empathy
in the empathizer. For example, previous functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) research demonstrated the engagement
of the premotor cortex when participants viewed images of
individuals in distressing situations and were instructed to empathize
(Nummenmaa et al., 2008 ).
Furthermore, the involvement of the observation execution
system may play a role in the execution of the emotional sharing task
itself. Previous studies examining interbrain coupling of the right
IFG have shown that it is involved in successful joint attention tasks
(Koike et al., 2016 ;Saito et al., 2010 ), face-to-face synchrony motor
tasks ( Marton-Alper et al., 2023 ), and shared goal achievement
requiring temporal coordination of actions ( Newman-Norlund
et al., 2008 ).
Greater interbrain coupling within the dlPFC also signi ﬁcantly
predicted distress relief of targets (reduced sadness levels). The
current literature on emotion regulation points to both the right and
left dlPFC as key players in exerting emotional regulation processes
(Kroes et al., 2019 ;Lorenz et al., 2003 ;Ochsner et al., 2012 ;Rêgo
et al., 2015 ) that are primarily through top-down cognitive mechanisms
(Dörfel et al., 2014 ;Drabant et al., 2009 ;Morawetz et al., 2017 ;
Zhao et al., 2021 ), as the dlPFC is also part of the executive network
(Morawetz et al., 2020 ).
In line with our results that the activation of the left dlPFC is
associated with distress regulation, previous studies have shown the
left dlPFC to be involved in the regulation of pain perception ( Brighina
et al., 2011 ,Lorenz et al., 2003 ;Nahmias et al., 2009 ;Seminowicz &
Moayedi, 2017 ). A recent meta-analysis of fMRI studies using
psychophysiological interaction analysis showed convergent connec-
tivity between the amygdala and right dlPFC during the down-
regulation of negative emotions ( Berboth & Morawetz, 2021 ),showing that the activation of the right dlPFC may potentially
impact emotional regulation during our emotional sharing task
through its communication with subcortical brain regions.
Furthermore, in a study using bih emispheric transcranial direct
current stimulation (tDCS) over the dlPFC to assess emotional
reactions elicited by pain observa tion, both left-cathodal/right-
anodal and left-anodal/right-cathodal tDCS decreased hostility,
sadness, and self-pain perceptio n, suggesting a common role for
left and right dlPFC in personal distress modulation ( Rêgo et al.,
2015 ). Intriguingly, an fMRI study by Morawetz et al. (2016)
linked both the IFG and dlPFC to distinct processes in emotional
regulation, whereby the IFG selects a single goal-appropriate
reappraisal from multiple options held in working memory
(represented in the dlPFC), and then inhibits the dlPFC upon
selection completion.
While numerous intrabrain studies have demonstrated the dlPFC ’s
role in distress regulation, the question remains, how might interbrain
coupling of the dlPFC between target and empathizer contribute to
distress reduction in the target? One possibility is that the attunement
of the empathizer to the emotions of the target contributes to dyadic
coupling which allows coregulation of affective states during the
emotional sharing. Furthermore, interbrain coupling between
empathizer and target within the dlPFC might re ﬂect the extent of
cooperation to coregulate as previous hyperscanning studies that
have linked dlPFC coupling with successful cooperative interactions
between two individuals ( Nguyen et al., 2020 ,2021;Reindl et al.,
2018). Further supporting the dlPFC ’s role in emotion regulation are
the results of our mediation analysis, where interbrain coupling levels
in the L. dlPFC-R. dlPFC partially mediated the effect that state
empathy levels had on target distress relief. While the dlPFC is
commonly known for its role in emotion regulation, it has been also
previously involved in the formation of cognitive empathic responses
(Naor et al., 2018 ;Powell, 2018 ;Weisz & Cikara, 2021 ). Interbrain
coupling in the L. dlPFC-R. dlPFC might serve a mechanistic role in
the link between empathic processes and distress regulation in the
target. It is thus possible that during empathetic interactions, the IFG
plays a critical role in enabling the participants to share emotions and
diminish the distinction between their individual experiences. At the
same time, interbrain coupling within the dlPFC regions may support
the collaborative regulation of emotions between the target and the
empathizer.
Constraints on Generality
The relevance of our study ’sﬁndings to broader theoretical
frameworks on dyadic interpersonal emotion regulation ( Simons
et al., 2017 ) may have certain limitations. While attempts were made
to make the emotional sharing task as ecological as possible, it
should be acknowledged that the “role assignment ”of empathizer
and target makes the conversation less spontaneous and less like real
life. Second, we address the generalizability of our sample. While
our sample included culturally different participants with different
native tongues (Hebrew and Arabic), it did exclude participants
diagnosed with a medical condition. Therefore, our behavioral and
neural ﬁndings should be limited to nonclinical populations.
Furthermore, the applicability of our study ’sﬁndings is con ﬁned to
individuals who are unacquainted, rather than closely acquainted,
such as signi ﬁcant others or friends. The results should be treated
with caution when extending to other relationship contexts. For this748 AVNOR, ATIAS, MARKUS, AND SHAMAY-TSOORY

reason, future research should investigate emotion regulation and
empathy processes in different dyadic and group contexts.
Conclusion
Our study reveals the emergence of emotional convergence
during emotional sharing, wher e empathy assumes a pivotal role
in shaping the sharing experience. Notably, we observed that
interbrain coupling in the IFG, premotor cortex and in the dlPFC is
associated with the extent of dist ress experienced after sharing.
These ﬁndings suggest that interbrain coupling may serve as a
mechanism of connectedness during emotional sharing, contribut-
ing to the emergence of attuned responses and ultimately in ﬂuencing
the levels of distress the target experiences. Since we did not
explore the speci ﬁc communication signals (e.g., facial expressions,
prosody) contributing to these associations, future research can
characterize the relationship between distinct behavioral signals and
their contributions to reducing distress. Finally, it is imperative to
investigate causality to ascertain whether the observed interbrain
coupling genuinely in ﬂuences the distress of the target.
