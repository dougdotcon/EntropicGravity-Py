## 📄 Abstract

While extant research on empathy has made significant progress in uncovering the mechanisms underlying the responses of an observer (empathizer) to the distress of another (target), it remains unclear how the interaction between the empathizer and the target contributes to distress regulation in the target. 

This study proposes that behavioral and neural coupling during empathic interactions contribute to diminished distress. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), the researchers measured interbrain coupling in the **dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)** and the **inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)**.

**Key Findings:**
- During emotional sharing, the target and empathizer emotionally converge.
- Empathizers’ empathy levels predicted both emotional convergence and target distress relief.
- Interbrain coupling in the dlPFC, IFG, and premotor cortex predicted distress relief in the target.
- dlPFC coupling mediated the relationship between distress relief and the empathizer's empathy levels.

**Keywords:** interbrain coupling, prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, emotion regulation, empathy.

## 🧠 Research Overview

### 1. Introduction
Humans have an inherent inclination to respond to the distress of others. Empathy is a multifaceted construct representing the ability to share the emotional state of others and take their perspective. This research shifts the focus from just the empathizer's response to how the **interaction** itself coregulates the target's distress through interbrain coupling.

### 2. Method
- **Participants:** 37 pairs of previously unacquainted participants (N = 74).
- **Task:** A 5-minute face-to-face emotional sharing task where one participant shared a distressing biographical experience.
- **Measurement:** Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure interbrain coupling.
- **Regions of Interest (ROIs):**
  - Left/Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG)
  - Left/Right Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC)
  - Left/Right Premotor Area

### 3. Key Results
#### Behavioral Results
- **Emotional Convergence:** The emotional gap between the target and empathizer diminished significantly by the end of the interaction.
- **Empathy as Predictor:** Higher levels of **perspective taking** (cognitive empathy) in empathizers were associated with reduced sadness in targets.

#### Neural Results (Interbrain Coupling)
- **Real-Dyads vs. Pseudodyads:** Real pairs showed significantly higher interbrain coupling than randomly paired individuals.
- **Distress Relief Correlation:** Coupling in the IFG, premotor cortex, and dlPFC significantly predicted sadness reduction.
- **Mediation Role:** dlPFC coupling (specifically L.dlPFC-R.dlPFC) partially mediated the effect of empathizer empathy on target distress relief.

### 4. Discussion & Conclusion
The findings suggest that interbrain coupling serves as a mechanism of **connectedness** during emotional sharing. The dlPFC, known for its role in top-down emotion regulation, appears to support collaborative regulation of emotions between two people. This "dyadic coregulation" is a key component in how empathy effectively alleviates suffering.
